Find the minimum distance a soldier must travel in order to be in a position to direclty hit the target.

There are some bullet proof walls that deflect the bullet.

However the soldier can walk through those.


For example, take a look at the grid below

![sample grid](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashhadulislam/soldier-spotter/master/img2.jpg)


There are 5 rows and 4 columns in this grid

The soldier is standing at (4,3)

The cells are bullet proof at (3,1 and 2,2)

However the soldier can walk through those

The target is at (1,2)

Possible soldiers from which the soldier can hit the target are

(1,1)
(1,3)
(1,4)
(2,3)
(3,4)
